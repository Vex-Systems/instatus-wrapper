# Instatus wrapper
An simple wrapper that bypasses the $15 <a href="instatus.com">instatus.com</a> restriction for function called "Custom domains"

# How to use?
Fork this repo, then go to <a href="https://github.com/Vex-Systems/instatus-wrapper/blob/main/public/config.js">this file</a> and change the instatus url to one of yours.

That's all! Now you can host it on vercel.app and have unlimited custom domains instead of one in pro plan and three in business plan.

# Why?
I hate features being put behind paywalls, even for this such simple thing, competition like BetterStack have this option in their base plan, why make it such a trouble to add a subdomain. It is understandable to have more options in paid plans but why restrict such a basic one, cmon :)
