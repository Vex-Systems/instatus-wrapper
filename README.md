That's all! Now you can host it on vercel.app and have unlimited custom domains instead of one in pro plan and three in business plan.

# Why?
I hate features being put behind paywalls, even for this such simple thing, competition like BetterStack have this option in their base plan, why make it such a trouble to add a subdomain. It is understandable to have more options in paid plans but why restrict such a basic one, cmon :)
